- Provides and intuitive way to record business transactions.

- Integrates with other apps to collate other business transactions handled separatley.

Any asset that can be realized for revenue is considered inventory.

## Types of inventory

The **Inventory** app is equipped to handle:

- **Merchandise**, which is products ordered by a trader to sell for a profit.
- **Finished Goods**, which are the end product of the manufacturing process.
- **Raw Materials**, which are the unprocessed goods used by a manufacturing business.
- **Work-in-progress** inventory, which are the semi-processed **Raw Materials** in the manufacturing process.
- **Maintenance, Repair & Operations** inventory, which are the supplies used in completing the production process.
- Packaging materials, which is either **Primary Packaging Inventory** without which the goods are not usable, or **Secondary Packaging Inventory** which is the packing done for convenient transportation of goods.

## Know what you're counting

Units of measurements are important metrics that give you an in-dept understanding of the quantity of inventory in storage. The **Inventory** app gives you some options, however, you are free to include yours. If you are unsure what you are counting you could use either of the following:

- **Piece** which is part of a larger whole.
- or **Unit** which is a standard measure of a quantity.

## Still particular about the small details?

You can imbue further meaning by attaching tags to your inventory. These tags could be model information, additional grouping information, or any detail you would like. However, you want to avoid including information already captured, such as units, type of inventory, and supplier to tags. There exist apps like the **Purchase** app designed to capture this information.
